### Average Orders per Hour and Day

######## The busiest hours of the pizzeria, in terms of the average number of orders, are between **12pm** and **2pm** and between **4pm** and **7pm**. On **Fridays** and **Saturdays** orders remain high until **9pm**

```{r, out.width="95%", out.height="50%"}

knitr::include_graphics("graphics/heatmap2.jpeg")


```


### Average Pizzas per Hour and Day

######## From **Monday** to **Friday**, between noon and **2 am**, approximately **20** pizzas are sold per hour, which is equivalent to  **one** pizza every **3** minutes. Are pizzaiolos or ninjas working in the kitchen?  
######## It is worth mentioning that despite the high number of orders between 4 pm and 7 pm shown in the previous chart, the lower number of pizzas sold suggests that at **these times people do not go to the pizzeria in large groups, such as at lunchtime**.

Column

### Pizza types

######## it is intersting to note that the three most sold  pizzas, in terms of total revenue, are the **Chicken** type ones. 

######## **The Classic Deluxe** is the best  selling type of pizza in terms of quantity and **The Thai Chicken** is the type with the highest revenue.

######## **The Green Garden**, **The Spinach Supreme** and **The Brie Carre** are not doing so well in terms of revenue.
